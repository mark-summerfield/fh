# fh

The `fh` “file history” tool is a command line tool which provides similar
features to the
[`FileHistory`](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/filehistory)
application. Both are built on the
[`fhd`](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/fhd) library.

> The File History project is an **experiment** --- _use at your own risk!_
> The purpose is to provide file history for users who don't have the
> technical knowledge/interest in using a full-blown version control system,
> even finding GUIs like `tortoisehg` and `qgit` too complicated to use,
> but who want to have something more convenient than saving copies of their
> files with dates added to the filenames or similar.
